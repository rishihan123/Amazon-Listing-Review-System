# Amazon-Listing-Review-System
Web application which scrapes reviews for an Amazon product, cleans and analyzes the reviews and creates graphical visualizations of the data which are all displayed to the user.

As of the time this is uploaded, this application works but not as well as intended. It is supposed to iterate through and scrape 50 pages of reviews but after 2 iterations, Amazon starts to block the requests. The app still works but the data used to create the graphs is a much smaller sample than intended.

A folder named "static" must be in the same file path as the main.py application
